Semantic versioning
Semantic versioning is a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, i.e. breaking changes.

MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, i.e. non-breaking changes.

PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
